# Overview

Provides a PHP generator to produce Dockerfiles and related files. It's target is mostly Laravel, but should work for most PHP applications.

## Usage

This project provides a CLI application that generates a Dockerfile( and related files ) for your Laravel applications! 

### Current Features
The Dockerfile generated by this project aims to provide support for:
1. Running your app by default in an Nginx-flavored server.
2. Or, running your app in an Octane-Flavored server: franken-php, roadrunner, swoole.
3. Building assets for Vite or Mix flavored asset packaging
4. Scheduler in the same container
5. Fly.io relevant scripts

The Dockerfile generated uses the base image published from https://github.com/fly-apps/laravel-docker/tree/main. Every feature from the Docker image published from that repository, is of course, by nature of things-passed-over to a dependent, also available in the Dockerfile generated by this project ( unless overridden ).

### How to Run
This repository contains a binary of a standalone application. For now, you can use this to generate a Dockerfile for your Laravel application. 

Clone this repository into your workspace, and run the application from the base directory of the Laravel project you want to Dockerize:

```
<path-to-project-dir>/builds/dockerfile-laravel generate
```

Running the command above should generate a Dockerfile in your Laravel application's base directory. Once that's available, you can build a Docker image out of it:

```
docker build -t <image-name> . 
```

You can run an instance of this image afterwards:

```
docker run -p <port-you-in-your-machine>:8080 <image-name>
```

And access your Laravel app in the browser by visiting the local instance of it: `127.0.0.1:<port-in-your-machine>`

## Local Development

Feel free to make contributions to this project to further improve its features. Of course, you've got to commit to some local development on your contribution, first.

### Get Familiar with These
Where do you start? First, get familiar with the VIP files of this project:
1. [app/Commands/GenerateCommand.php](https://github.com/fly-apps/dockerfile-laravel/blob/d3254571d874b24340d614ff62c931d07495365e/app/Commands/GenerateCommand.php#L8)
    - This is the entrypoint to the application. This is in charge of generating a Dockerfile in a project's base directory based on the dockerfile.blade.php template, and the flags passed to it.

2. [resources/views/dockerfile.blade.php](https://github.com/fly-apps/dockerfile-laravel/blob/d3254571d874b24340d614ff62c931d07495365e/resources/views/dockerfile.blade.php#L1)
    - This is the template used to generate a Dockerfile 


### Configuration
Alright, now that you're familiar with the important files to commit your changes, you can make changes right, right?

Not quite! Before diving into making those changes, there's some to-do's to get you setup with local development on the package:

1. Clone the repository
2. Get the repo dependencies with `composer install`
3. Make your changes
4. Provide the proper permission to the box package used by Laravel Zero framework: `chmod 755 vendor/laravel-zero/framework/bin/box`. 


### Testing Changes

Once you have your changes, you can test them locally by running `php dockerfile-laravel generate`. This will call the command found in `app/Commands/GenerateCommand.php`. 

### Building Changes

Great! You've tested your changes locally. It's time to re-build the stand-alone application for the repository, so that your changes get included. 

Simply run the build command:

```
php dockerfile-laravel app:build --build-version=1.0
```

#### Build View Changes 
If changes were made in any of the view files used by the package, make sure to clear the cached views( For now, manually deleting them--sorry folks! ). The view cache path can be configured in `config/view.php`. If you don't delete cached views, your fresh changes are unlikely to be included in the features of the build made from your changes.

So, if your view changes don't seem to be working, do delete any cached view files you find, then re-build your changes.

#### Testing the newly-Built Application
Now that you've built your changes into the project's stand alone application binary, you have to test this out too. Testing local changes shouldn't be enough!

Simply, in any directoy of your choosing run the following:
```
<path-to-project-dir>/builds/dockerfile-laravel generate
```

And that's it!

## Contribution

Once you've cooked up and tested your local changes, you can make a Pull Request to include it in this repository. The Laravel team at Fly.io will review your PR, this helps the repository a ton. Your contribution will be much appreciated---thank you!
